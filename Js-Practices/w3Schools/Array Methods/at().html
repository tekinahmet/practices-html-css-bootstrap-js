    <h1>JavaScript Arrays</h1>
    <h2>The at() Method</h2>

    <p>The at() method returns an indexed element from an array:</p>

    <p id="demo"></p>

    <!-- Many languages allows negative bracket indexing like [-1] to access elements from the end of an object / array / string.

      This is not possible in JavaScript, because [] is used for accessing both arrays and objects. obj[-1] refers to the value of key -1, not to the last property of the object. -->

    <!-- The at() method returns an indexed element from an array.
      The at() method returns the same as []. -->
    <script>
      const fruits = ["Banana", "Orange", "Apple", "Mango"];
      let fruit = fruits.at(2);

      document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML = fruit; //Apple
    </script>
